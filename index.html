                  After the vicious slaughter of his family by stone-cold
                  mercenary Sub-Zero, Hanzo Hasashi is exiled to the torturous
                  Netherrealm. There, in exchange for his servitude to the
                  sinister Quan Chi, he's given a chance to avenge his family -
                  and is resurrected as Scorpion, a lost soul bent on revenge.
                  Back on Earthrealm, Lord Raiden gathers a team of elite
                  warriors - Shaolin monk Liu Kang, Special Forces officer Sonya
                  Blade and action star Johnny Cage - an unlikely band of heroes
                  with one chance to save humanity. To do this, they must defeat
                  Shang Tsung's horde of Outworld gladiators and reign over the
                  Mortal Kombat tournament.
